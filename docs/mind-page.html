            <p>This is a podcast that my dad and I started during our quarantine summer. We wanted a place to share our thoughts about anything and everything. Our front porch was our favorite place to talk, so we wanted to bring that space to everyone. The result was Front Porch Philosophy.</p>

            <p>Here you can check out a variety of work that I've done while
            in school. Some of it is papers I've written, some of it other projects.
            Really anything that has helped me think critcally or in a new
            way about something can be found here. I hope to one day be able to add some more impressive projects to
               this list but for now, I'm happy to share what I have so far! If
               something catches your eye, click on it to download the file.
